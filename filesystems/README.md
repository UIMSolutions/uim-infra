A **file system** (often abbreviated as **FS**) is a fundamental component in computing that **controls how data is stored and retrieved**.

**Data Organization**: Imagine a storage medium (like a hard drive or SSD) without a file system. In that case, all data would be one large blob with no way to distinguish where one piece of data ends and the next begins. A file system provides the structure needed to organize data into files and directories.

**File Operations**: With a file system, you can perform essential operations on files:

- **Create**: You can create new files.
- **Read**: You can retrieve data from existing files.
- **Update**: You can modify the content of files.
- **Delete**: You can remove files.

**Mapping Addresses**: For users, file names need to match the internal addresses used by the computer. The file system ensures that these two align correctly.

**Retrieval and Storage**: A file systemâ€™s primary tasks include making data easy to find (for quick retrieval) and ensuring secure storage.

**Integral Part of DComputers**: File systems are an integral part of computer systems and operating systems. They consider device properties and play a crucial role in managing data on storage volumes.

**Access via Directory Structure**: To access files and directories, you navigate through the directory structure provided by the file system.
