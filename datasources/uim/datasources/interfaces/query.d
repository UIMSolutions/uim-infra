    /**
     * Adds a condition or set of conditions to be used in the WHERE clause for this
     * query. Conditions can be expressed as an array of fields as keys with
     * comparison operators in it, the values for the array will be used for comparing
     * the field to such literal. Finally, conditions can be expressed as a single
     * string or an array of strings.
     *
     * When using arrays, each entry will be joined to the rest of the conditions using
     * an AND operator. Consecutive calls to this auto will also join the new
     * conditions specified using the AND operator. Additionally, values can be
     * expressed using expression objects which can include other query objects.
     *
     * Any conditions created with this methods can be used with any SELECT, UPDATE
     * and DELETE type of queries.
     *
     * ### Conditions using operators:
     *
     * ```
     * aQuery.where([
     *    'posted >=": new DateTime("3 days ago"),
     *    'title LIKE": 'Hello W%",
     *    'author_id": 1,
     * ], ["posted": 'datetime"]);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE posted >= 2012-01-27 AND title LIKE 'Hello W%' AND author_id = 1`
     *
     * Second parameter is used to specify what type is expected for each passed
     * key. Valid types can be used from the mapped with Database\Type class.
     *
     * ### Nesting conditions with conjunctions:
     *
     * ```
     * aQuery.where([
     *    'author_id !=": 1,
     *    'OR": ["published": true, "posted <": new DateTime("now")],
     *    'NOT": ["title": 'Hello"]
     * ], ["published": boolean, "posted": 'datetime"]
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE author_id = 1 AND (published = 1 OR posted < '2012-02-01") AND NOT (title = "Hello")`
     *
     * You can nest conditions using conjunctions as much as you like. Sometimes, you
     * may want to define 2 different options for the same key, in that case, you can
     * wrap each condition inside a new array:
     *
     * `aQuery.where(["OR": [["published": false], ["published": true]])`
     *
     * Keep in mind that every time you call where() with the third param set to false
     * (default), it will join the passed conditions to the previous stored list using
     * the AND operator. Also, using the same array key twice in consecutive calls to
     * this method will not override the previous value.
     *
     * ### Using expressions objects:
     *
     * ```
     * exp = aQuery.newExpr().add(["id !=": 100, "author_id' != 1]).tieWith("OR");
     * aQuery.where(["published": true], ["published": 'boolean"]).where(exp);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE (id != 100 OR author_id != 1) AND published = 1`
     *
     * Other Query objects that be used as conditions for any field.
     *
     * ### Adding conditions in multiple steps:
     *
     * You can use callback to construct complex expressions, functions
     * receive as first argument a new QueryExpression object and this query instance
     * as second argument. Functions must return an expression object, that will be
     * added the list of conditions for the query using the AND operator.
     *
     * ```
     * aQuery
     * .where(["title !=": 'Hello World"])
     * .where(function (exp, aQuery) {
     *     or = exp.or(["id": 1]);
     *    and = exp.and(["id >": 2, "id <": 10]);
     * return or.add(and);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE title != "Hello World' AND (id = 1 OR (id > 2 AND id < 10))`
     *
     * ### Conditions as strings:
     *
     * ```
     * aQuery.where(["articles.author_id = authors.id", "modified isNull"]);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE articles.author_id = authors.id AND modified isNull`
     *
     * Please note that when using the array notation or the expression objects, all
     * values will be correctly quoted and transformed to the correspondent database
     * data type automatically for you, thus securing your application from SQL injections.
     * If you use string conditions make sure that your values are correctly quoted.
     * The safest thing you can do is to never use string conditions.
     * /
    auto where(/* Closure * / string[] conditionsToFilter = null, Json[string] types = null, bool shouldOverwrite = false);
